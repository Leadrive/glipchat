  - mobile -- you send an invite
    - if an active invitee opens the app after a notification and the inviter is active, they will get a dialog asking to join the room and a notification in their notification list for retrieval -- which shows 'join' cta until the users leave the room
    - if you invite non-users, they will go directly to room as guest. if the room is empty, user will be directed to notifications list on mobile or homepage on desktop. ~ implement with invitation codes in email
